# Ethical Communication Across Narrative Spaces

This repository is a place to maintain the files I once used to run an experiment on Baylor Campus. The experiment involved people being divided into two groups, A and B, playing through a web story, and answering some questions derived from a psychology questionnaire based on Moral Foundations Theory (Jonathan Haidt).

## Hypothesis
We were testing whether Player A could successfully replicate their points of view about loyalty when interacting with NPC characters in a story and then have a second Player B receive those opinions in a related story and reproduce their point of view.

## Procedure
The procedure was straightforward. Player A played through an interactive story, was asked questions about their thoughts on loyalty and ethics (in which the answer choices were narrative representations of Likert data), and then answered those same questions out of a narrative context in the form of actual Likert data through a subset of questions from the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). Player B would then go through a non-interactive story in which Player A's in-game responses were re-iterated to them (they "investigated" the character that Player A had played as). They then had to try and predict how that character in the story, i.e. Player A, would have responded to those same loyalty-testing questions from the MFQ.

## Results
The hope was that each set of comparisons (Player A survey -> Player A game, Player B game -> Player B survey) would result in closely similar data. This was not the case for the majority of questions, although some appeared relatively effective (an absolute value difference of approximately 1 given answer choices ranging from 1 to 6). The study gave some suggestions from how future research could be improved, but was not enough to give us sufficient evidence to support the claim that game narrative media are an effective means of communicating sophisticated, interpretive concepts between humans.

2 Twine stories combined with the HTML/CSS/JS/MySQL/PHP files I needed to run a research study evaluating people's capacity to communicate with each other at a high level from within the narrative context of a game world and WITHOUT directly interacting.
